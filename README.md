# Project's Name
The project's name is **Quiz Time** and it was created using Front end technologies only. The live website can be found [here](https://stefanmdvs.github.io/quiz-codeInstitute/index.html). 

# Purpose
The project was created as part of my journey with Code Institute for the Milestone 2 project. The purpose was to implement the front end technologies learned and create a website focused on user interaction. 

# UX
## User stories
1. User can intuitevely navigate across the website;
2. User can choose a category they want to play;
3. User can see their quiz progress;
4. User can see how they were doing at the end;
5. User can contact the developer.
## Structure
The website contains the landing page, the *About* section containing information about the game, and the *Contact* page where user can fill in a contact form.  
For a good user experience, the header and footer are displayed on each page and a Facebook share button has been added.
## Design
### Colour scheme
I have started from the dark grey color as a background and from there I chose a light grey/blue colour for the text. For the navigation links and footer I went for a strong green, the same colour being used as border colour on hover over buttons.
### Typography
The project uses two different Google fonts families, *Roboto mono* for headers  and *Raleway* for paragraphs, navigation and buttons.
### Wireframes
Wireframes are available for each section and different screen sizes. Full size wireframes can be accessed as follows:
